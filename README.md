# Detecting-Fraud-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
My project concentrates on the issue of fraud detection in financial transactions, specifically for credit cards. My goal was to properly identify fraudulent activity while avoiding false positives. Access the Data on Kaggle: [Credit Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?datasetId=310&sortBy=voteCount)

Setup Instructions: This notebook works within Jupyter Notebook with the imports provided in the cells and using python 3. Additionally, ensure the dataset is downloaded and imported as a csv file and within the same folder as the .ipynb file.
