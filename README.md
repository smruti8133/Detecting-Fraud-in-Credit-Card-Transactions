# Detecting-Fraud-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
My project concentrates on the issue of fraud detection in financial transactions, specifically for credit cards. My goal was to properly identify fraudulent activity while avoiding false positives. Access the Data on Kaggle: [Credit Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?datasetId=310&sortBy=voteCount)

No specific setup instructions, this notebook works with the imports provided in the cells and using python 3.
